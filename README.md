# random-color-component

Here I practiced using useEffect. I learned that a side-effect is anything that React doesn't control, such as api handling, direct manipulation of the DOM, and setTimeOut. When setting useEffect you will most likely set the dependancy array to an empty array, rendering the component only once. And, if you want the effect to run after something changes, you can add it to the dependancy array. There's a lot more to understand with useEffect, I will update with more info ince I have it understood.
